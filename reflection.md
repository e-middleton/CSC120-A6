- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Inheritance made my job a whole lot shorter, and if there's an error in the parent, it'll be a lot easier to fix than just going through each class individually.
I think everything works now, but I'm sure there's some secret bug hiding out that I haven't thought to check. 
Honestly I don't have a ton of thoughts right now, I'm just curious to see how we deal with inheriting things we don't want/need to change. 
The only thing I would say for this assignment is keep testing as you go I guess?
I am curious though when it's good to use try catch blocks vs if else statements, because I started making try catch blocks, but I ended up getting rid of them because I needed the method to return false sometimes instead of just giving me an exception.
